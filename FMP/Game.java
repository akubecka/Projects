    Game takes care of one game
    Maybe make a week class that runs all the games of the week?
    Run through the 90 minutes and run probabilities of a team/player:
        Scoring
        Injury
        Fight
        Yellow/Red
        Foul/Penalty
        Shots
    Team Advantages
        Home
        Form(Maybe put in Team class)
        Fan Hype
    Player Advantages
